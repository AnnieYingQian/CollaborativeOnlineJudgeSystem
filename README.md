# CollaborativeOnlineJudgeSystem
This is a full-stack project with an Angular based front end, NodeJS based restful API, and docker based code execution engine. We created multiple components in the front end to allow users to review and add problems and provide solution. The data is passed to the restful API, which in turn saves to MongoDB. Multiple users can also collaborate on problems real-time using websocket.

Code will be on the branch of AnnieYingQian
